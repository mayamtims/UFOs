# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that documents different UFO sightings around the world. The data was displayed in a table and was stored as a JavaScript array and is filterable by date, city, state, country and shape of sighting. 

## Results
The webpage has a large table with documented UFO sightings. The table can be filtered by different characteristics of the sightings. 

Below is an image of the table, filtered for state (California) and shape of sighting (triangle):
